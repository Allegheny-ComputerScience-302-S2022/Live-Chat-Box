# CMPSC 302 Chat Server Feature Description

## In no more than 150 words, describe the chat feature you plan to implement.

I think I will implement a pop-up notification. I am not sure how to implement this, but I'd like to create a notification window and if you mention that person using the @ sign username and everyone, then theat person or user gets a notification.

## How do you plan to achieve this?

I will consult professor Luman about this.
